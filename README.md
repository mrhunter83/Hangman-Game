# 'The Walking Dead' themed hangman game

This is a simple web-based hangman game with a theme patterned after AMC's 'The Walking Dead' TV show.

INSTRUCTIONS AND MECHANICS:
1) Once loaded, the player can press any letter keyboard key to begin gameplay; the first letter key press will constitute the first guess, so choose wisely.
2) The player has 12 guesses to complete the word; if the player uses up all 12 guesses without completing the word, the player loses the game (the player will then have the option to start a new game).
3) Completing the word before using up all guesses counts as a win (the player is then given the option to start a new game).
